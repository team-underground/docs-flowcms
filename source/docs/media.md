#   Media


Flow CMS offers a central place to manage your media resources. Images uploaded via the media manager can be cropped using the asset URL. Here we have included the PHP intervention package for doing that.

>  Always give the full path of your resource
e.g. `http://{you_website}/{your_folder}/{your_file}.{file_extension}`
