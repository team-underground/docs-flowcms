FlowCMS uses internally some open-source third-party libraries/packages, many thanks to the web community:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - Open source full-stack framework.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) - A rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup.
